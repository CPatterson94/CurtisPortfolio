          I’m Daniel Patterson, a web developer based in Alpharetta, GA, serving
          metro Atlanta and surrounding areas. While I’m new to the tech
          industry, I’ve spent the last 15 years working at a hockey rink and
          coaching, which taught me a lot about teamwork, problem-solving, and
          constantly learning new things—skills I bring into every project I
          work on. I have a focus on front-end development with JavaScript,
          HTML5, and CSS, and I’ve been diving into React, Vue, and Angular. On
          the back-end, I work with Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. I’m
          also familiar with Git for version control and use SaSS for styling.
          I’m always excited to learn more and take on new challenges, so if
          there’s a tech I don’t know yet, I’m all in to pick it up! When I’m
          not coding, you’ll find me on the ice playing hockey, DJing, gaming,
          or getting lost in a good book. I’m excited to collaborate with you
          and help bring your web development projects to life.
